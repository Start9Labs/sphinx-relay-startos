  short: Chat on the Lightning Network.

    Sphinx Chat is a messaging service built on top of the Lightning Network. Each message sent and received
    on Sphinx is actually a transaction on Lightning. This serves to protect against spam and provides a
    means of monetizing content without trusted third parties.
